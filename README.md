# bootleg

Static website generation made simple. A powerful, fast, clojure html templating solution.

Bootleg is a command line tool that rapidly renders clojure based templates. With inbuilt support for html, hiccup, hickory, mustache, enlive, json, yaml and edn, it enables you to pull together disparate elements and glue them together to generate the static website of your dreams.

## Quickstart

A simple page:

    $ bootleg -e '[:html [:body [:h1 "A simple webpage"] [:p "Made with bootleg for maximum powers!"]]]'
    <html><body><h1>A simple webpage</h1><p>Made with bootleg for maximum powers!</p></body></html>

A dynamic example:

    $ bootleg -e '[:div.countdown (for [n (range 10 0 -1)] [:p n]) [:p "blast off!"]]'
    <div class="countdown"><p>10</p><p>9</p><p>8</p><p>7</p><p>6</p><p>5</p><p>4</p><p>3</p><p>2</p><p>1</p><p>blast off!</p></div>

Mustache:

    $ cd examples/quickstart
    $ bootleg -e '(mustache "quickstart.html" (yaml "fields.yml"))'
    <h1>Bootleg</h1>
    <h2>by Crispin</h2>
    <p>I'm going to rewrite all my sites with this!</p>

Markdown support. Easy downloading of resources by url (for any command):

    $ bootleg -e '(markdown "https://raw.githubusercontent.com/retrogradeorbit/bootleg/master/README.md")'
    <h1>bootleg</h1><p>Static website generation made simple. A powerful, fast, clojure templating solution that rocks!</p>...

CSS selector based processing. The magic of enlive:

    $ bootleg -e '(-> (markdown "examples/quickstart/simple.md") (at [:p] (set-attr :style "color:green;")))'
    <h1>Markdown support</h1><p style="color:green;">This is some simple markdown</p>

Fast startup and processing:

    $ time bootleg -e '(-> [:div [:h1.blurb] [:p.blurb]] (at [:.blurb] (content "blurb content") ))'
    <div><h1 class="blurb">blurb content</h1><p class="blurb">blurb content</p></div>

    real	0m0.007s
    user	0m0.004s
    sys	0m0.003s

Data output with -d flag:

    $ bootleg -d -e '(markdown "examples/quickstart/simple.md")'
    ([:h1 {} "Markdown support"] [:p {} "This is some simple markdown"])
